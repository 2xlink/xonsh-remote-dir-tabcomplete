# xonsh-remoteDirCompleter

This script enables tab completion for remote directories, just like fish and zsh do.

### Installation
Move the script to an appropriate location, and then add it to your completers by using
```
source /path/to/xonsh-remoteDirCompleter.py
completer add RemoteDirCompleter remoteDirCompleter
```
You might want to do this in your .xonshrc
